# One Week RL

Reinforcement Learning from scratch in a week.

## Overview

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to catch up with the recent reinforcement learning algorithms in a short time.
I'm also a beginner in reinforcement learning, so this is a learning project for myself.
Each day focuses on a specific topic, starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced concepts.

- [Day 1: Random Agent](./one_week_rl/day1_random/README.md)
- [Day 2: Q-Learning](./one_week_rl/day2_q_table/README.md)
- [Day 3: Deep Q-Network (DQN)](./one_week_rl/day3_dqn/README.md)
- [Day 4: REINFORCE](./one_week_rl/day4_reinforce/README.md)
- [Day 5: Actor-Critic](./one_week_rl/day5_a2c/README.md)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the desired day's directory.

```console
git clone https://github.com/toshihikoyanase/one-week-rl.git
cd one-week-rl
uv sync
```

Then you can run the code for each day using `uv run python <script_name>.py`.
See each day's README for specific instructions.
Enjoy your learning journey in reinforcement learning!
